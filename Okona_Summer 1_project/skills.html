        <h2 class="about_me">Drawing</h2>
        <p> I like to draw line drawing a lot and I ony have taken two actual art classes in middle school.Some artists that I look up to are Kim Jung Gi, Wayne Reynolds, and Levi Prewit.They sometimes inspire my art and I like to draw things in the fantsay and science fiction genre. I also like to draw things from videogames and movies. I like Star Wars and lord of the rings(including the video games) so I draw characters from those franchises a lot as well. I post some of my drawings on my Instagram account and the name of the account is @hipshmik2. Below is one of my drawings of darth vader and next to it is a quick sketch of afro samurai(it is squished so it ca match the darth vader photo).</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="img-column">
            <img src="image/IMG_1341.jpg">
            <img src="image/afro.jpg">
          </div>
        <h3 class="subsection"></h3>

        <p>For the Darth vader drawing I used makers called copuc markers. They are alchahol based so they are fun to play around with. All I used for the Afro Samurai sketch was a sharpie.</p>

        <h3 class="portfolio">Coding</h3>

        <p>I have some coding experience in multiple languages such as HTML,CSS,Javascript, and Python. I have a pretty strong bass in CSS and HTML but I am still learning Python and Javascript. Some things that I like to do in coding is makin website with Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and making simple games with Python such as Snake and Space Invaders. I have participated in the Hidden Genius Project and I have learned more about the four languages that I mentioned. Through this program I have gained skills in leadership, euntrepenuership, and how to manage my time. It was made possible for me to make this website because of the Hideen Genius Project because they gave me important skills for programming.</p>
