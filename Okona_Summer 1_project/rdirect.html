      <p>Hidden Genius Project Leader</p>
  <hr />
  <p>I think without the main leader helping me (David) I would not have made the website. David  gave me and all the other chort embers the source code for our websites and then we modded that code. Also whenever I needed help david would give me elpful advice so I think I consider David to be a recourse as well.</p>
