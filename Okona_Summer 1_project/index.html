        <p>My name is Okona Kwende and I am 14 years old.I live i Albany California and I will be a freshman next year at Albay High school. I am now in the Hidden Genius Project and currently studying programing languages including CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Some skills that I have are drawing, some knowledge of coding languages, and playing my trumpet. Some things that I like to do in my free time are playing musical instruments, playing viedo games, reading, occasionaly coding, and drawing. Some artists that I look up to are Kim Jung Gi, Wayne Reynolds, and Levi Prewit. I post art on my Instagram account and the name is @hipshmik2</p>

        <h3 class="subsection">Why do I want to be in the Hidden Genius Project?</h3>

        <p>I mostly came for the coding at first but then I realized that the program was very helpful in everything. I learned multiple things like how to code, euntrepenuership, and life skills.</p>
